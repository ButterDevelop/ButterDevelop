# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hi there!
I'm a developer with years of experience and a passion for programming that started in childhood from my love for games. My profile features a selection of top open-source projects that showcase my skills in C#, ASP.NET, and modern technologies. Check the pins at least.

But there are some recent repos which are private just for now, but I want to let you know about them:

- **BlumBotFarm:** The backend of a project that will be available soon (currently, only the frontend is open).
- **Statistical Project:** A multi-year development for automating Steam trading, featuring automated data parsers, massive datasets, a PyTorch neural network for data processing, and a bot with intelligent human-like algorithms.
- **Telegram Mini-Application:** A system designed for millions of users, built with ASP.NET and a microservices architecture. It leverages MongoDB with bit masking for performance, CDN, RabbitMQ (ensuring message delivery even during failures), Docker Compose, Kubernetes, AWS with Blue/Green deployment, Redis, high test coverage including integration tests, and automated deployment via GitHub Actions. The frontend is built with Next.js.

My journey is driven by continuous self-learning and the adoption of new ideas. I quickly adapt to new technologies, speak English, and have a strong foundation in mathematics and critical thinking. On top of that, I have musical training â€” so if needed, I can even organize a concert!

I'm excited for new opportunities and interesting projects!
